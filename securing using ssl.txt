1. Generate the Private Key and Certificate:

sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/selfsigned.crt

2. Configure Nginx to Use the Self-Signed Certificate:
Edit your Nginx configuration file (typically found in /etc/nginx/sites-available/).
Add or modify it to include the SSL certificate and key you just generated:

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name _;  # or your server's public IP address

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/selfsigned.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/selfsigned.key;

    # Rest of your configuration...
}

3. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (Optional):
    server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;  # or your server's public IP address
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

4.Reload Nginx to apply the changes:
    sudo systemctl reload nginx
